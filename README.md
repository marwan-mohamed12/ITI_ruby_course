# Ruby Bank Transaction Simulator

This project provides a simple simulation of bank transactions using Ruby, incorporating concepts like classes, modules, logging, and error handling.

## Description

The program simulates a basic banking system where transactions are processed for a set of users. Key features include:

- **User Management:**  Users have names and account balances.
- **Transaction Processing:** Transactions are created with a user and a value (amount).
- **Bank Logic:** The `CBABank` class implements the logic for processing transactions, including:
    - Checking if the user is associated with the bank.
    - Updating user balances.
    - Handling insufficient balance errors.
- **Logging:** The `Logger` module provides functions to log information, warnings, and errors to a file (`app.log`).
- **Callback Functionality:** A callback mechanism is used to simulate actions taken upon success or failure of a transaction.
